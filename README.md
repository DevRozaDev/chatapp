## Summary
The server part of a web service allowing for anonymous conversations between people called AnCzat (codename: chatapp).\
This project was part of my Bachelor's thesis. The backend part featured here was coded using Elixir with the Phoenix framework.\
The client portion of the project was also done by me, and extensively uses the Vue.js framework.
The webservice provides an anonymous space to discuss topics, without the need to log-in, but while still remembering invidivual user's sessions. Every chat participant is given a name corresponding to an animal species.
